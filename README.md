# Develop Environment
* Unity 2019.2.5f1


# Using Assets
If you want to clone to your environment, please import following assets.

* [Dynamic Bone](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dynamic-bone-16743)  
This is not necessarily required if you remove Dynamic Bone from Tech-chan 3D model.

If you want to move her accessories, you need to buy Dynamic Bone from asset store.

* [ユニティちゃんトゥーンシェーダー 2.0 / UTS2 v.2.0.7](http://unity-chan.com/download/releaseNote.php?id=UTS2_0)
I used UnityChanToonShader/Mobile/Toon_DoubleShadeWithFeather for Tech-chan 3D model.
If you don't want to use this shader, please change the material (Assets/TechChan/Materials).
